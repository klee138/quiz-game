The goal of this project was to create a timed quiz.
The timer begins when the quiz is initiated by user button click
Incorrect responses remove 10 seconds from the timer, which is set to an initial value of 70 seconds.
At the end of the questions, the remaining time value is used as the score.
This is when the user is prompted for initials and the final score is stored in local storage.
There is a link the navigation bar to the highscores page.
This page gets highscore values from local storage.
